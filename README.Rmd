## Overview
This R package serves as a color palette generator for color schemes
to be used in plotting data. The original set of colors schemes for this
package was based on the colors found on LaCroix cans. Later, color schemes
from other popular media were also used (e.g. other beverages, movies, etc.
). I hope you find the colors pleasing to the eye. Thanks!
