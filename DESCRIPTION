Description: This package serves as a color palette generator for color schemes
    to be used in plotting data. The original set of colors schemes for this
    package was based on the colors found on LaCroix cans. Later, color schemes
    from other popular media were also used (e.g. other beverages, movies, etc.
    ). I hope you find the colors pleasing to the eye. Thanks!
